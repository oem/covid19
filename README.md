# Elm, tailwindcss 2 and Parcel template project

A template project to be able to use elm together with tailwind 2, using parcel.

The process will be simpler, once parcel-bundler works with tailwindcss 2.

## Development

This is a bit of an experiment, to see if I can make elm and tailwindcss 2 work together with some help from Parcel.

Install all dependencies with `npm i`.

Then run the dev server with `npm run dev`.

To create a release build: `npm run build`.
